Internetowa aplikacja Java wykorzystująca Java Server Faces (JSF) Framework

Scenario: Grocery shopping system
Specify, design, implement and test a system for ordering groceries. There must be at
least two user types, three stores, and five products.

Design your system
Use the Unified Software Development Process (USDP) to design your application. You
will need a use-case diagram, activity diagrams, analysis models, class diagrams,
sequence diagrams and a page navigation diagram. The case study is a good example of
the standard required.
Your web application must demonstrate the following features:

 The MVC architecture

 Design patterns

 A login process

 At least two types of user – administrator and standard user

 Query the database and present the result-set in a manner that is appropriate for
the user that is currently logged in

 Perform insert, update, and delete operations on the database in response to user
interactions

Implement your web application
Implement your web application, which must:

 Adhere to the design submitted for Part 1

 Interact with a database to perform insert, update, and delete operations on the
database in response to user interactions

 Use JavaServer Faces

Test your implementation
Write a test plan (automated wherever possible), and test your web application. As well
as unit tests, you should include integration tests that are based on your use cases.
